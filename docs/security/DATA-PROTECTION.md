- ✅ 256-bit salts (cryptographically secure)
- ✅ Session tokens (64-character hex)
- ✅ Rate limiting (prevents brute force)
- ✅ Auto-logout (15-minute inactivity)
- ✅ IP address tracking

#### 5. **Data Access Control**
- ✅ Role-based access (admin/user)
- ✅ PIN verification for database operations
- ✅ Session validation on every request
- ✅ Dangerous query confirmations
- ✅ Non-editable system columns

#### 6. **Audit Trail & Accountability**
- ✅ Complete audit logging

- ✅ IP address logging
- ✅ Failed attempt tracking
- ✅ Exportable audit reports

#### 7. **Connection Security**
- ✅ Connection pooling (prevents exhaustion)
- ✅ Connection timeout (10 seconds)
- ✅ Query timeout (30 seconds)
- ✅ Automatic reconnection handling
- ✅ Connection state validation

## 🚨 **Additional Critical Protections Needed**

### **IMPLEMENTING NOW:**

#### 1. **Environment Variable Enforcement**
- ⚠️ Force production mode to require env vars
- ⚠️ Never allow database credentials in code
- ⚠️ Encrypt credentials in transit

#### 2. **HTTPS Enforcement**
- ⚠️ Force HTTPS in production
- ⚠️ Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- ⚠️ HSTS headers (prevent downgrade attacks)

#### 3. **Content Security Policy**

- ⚠️ Block inline scripts
- ⚠️ Frame protection
- ⚠️ XSS filter headers

#### 4. **Database Connection Encryption**
- ⚠️ Require SSL/TLS for database connections
- ⚠️ Certificate validation
- ⚠️ Encrypted connection strings

#### 5. **Data Export Security**
- ⚠️ Rate limit exports
- ⚠️ Size limits on exports
- ⚠️ Audit all exports
- ⚠️ PIN verification required

#### 6. **CSRF Protection**
- ⚠️ CSRF tokens for all mutations
- ⚠️ SameSite cookie attributes
