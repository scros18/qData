# 🔧 What's Happening During Installation

## Current Status: NORMAL ✅

You're seeing the Debian package manager updating the system. This is **completely normal** and expected!

## What You're Seeing:

```
update-alternatives: using /var/lib/mecab/dic/ipadic to provide...
Setting up mecab-ipadic-utf8...
Processing triggers for man-db...
Processing triggers for libc-bin...
Scanning processes...
Scanning Linux images...

Running kernel seems to be up-to-date.
No services need to be restarted.
No containers need to be restarted.
No user sessions are running outdated binaries.
No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries...
```

This means:
1. ✅ System packages are being updated
2. ✅ Dependencies are being installed
3. ✅ System is checking for outdated services
4. ✅ Everything is up-to-date

## What Happens Next:

The `install-mysql.sh` script will:

### Phase 1: System Updates (Currently Running)
- Updating package lists
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up locales

### Phase 2: MySQL Installation (Next ~2-3 minutes)
- Download MySQL server packages
- Install MySQL 8.0
- Configure MySQL
- Start MySQL service

### Phase 3: MySQL Security (Next)
- Remove test databases
- Secure root account
- Create qdata_admin user
- **GENERATE PASSWORDS** ← You'll see these!

### Phase 4: Configuration
- Configure for remote access
- Set up firewall rules
- Install Node.js 20.x
- Install PM2

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline:

- **0-2 min**: System updates (current)
- **2-5 min**: MySQL installation
- **5-7 min**: Configuration
- **Total**: ~7-10 minutes

## 🎯 What to Look For:

The script will display something like:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     QData Installation - SAVE THESE CREDENTIALS       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

MySQL ROOT Credentials (Admin Access)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Username: root
Password: [RANDOM 25-CHARACTER PASSWORD]

QData Admin User (Recommended for QData)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Username: qdata_admin
Password: [RANDOM 25-CHARACTER PASSWORD]
```

**🚨 COPY THESE PASSWORDS IMMEDIATELY! 🚨**

## 📝 While Waiting:

1. ✅ Keep the terminal open
2. ✅ Prepare a place to save passwords (password manager, notepad)
3. ✅ Wait for the credentials to appear
4. ✅ The script will pause and ask you to press ENTER after copying

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- **Don't close the terminal** - let it complete
- **Don't interrupt the process** - it's automated
- **Be ready to copy passwords** - they'll only show once
- **Press ENTER** when prompted after copying passwords

## 🐛 If You See Errors:

### Common Issues:

**"Unable to locate package mysql-server"**
- Solution: The script handles this, just wait

**"dpkg was interrupted"**
- Run: `sudo dpkg --configure -a`
- Then re-run: `./install-mysql.sh`

**"Port 3306 already in use"**
- MySQL is already installed
- Skip to: `./deploy-qdata.sh`

**Connection timeout**
- Check internet connection
- Re-run the script

## 📋 Current Progress Indicator:

```
[✅] System package update
[⏳] MySQL installation       ← You are here
[ ] MySQL security setup
[ ] User creation
[ ] Node.js installation
[ ] PM2 installation
[ ] Firewall configuration
[ ] Display credentials
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Installation:

Once you see the credentials:

1. **Copy passwords** to safe location
2. **Press ENTER** to continue
3. **Delete credentials file**: `rm ~/qdata-credentials.txt`
4. **Run deployment**: `./deploy-qdata.sh`

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Open a second terminal/SSH session now so you can:
- Monitor system resources: `htop`
- Check MySQL status: `sudo systemctl status mysql`
- View logs: `tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log`

## ✅ Everything is Normal!

Your installation is progressing correctly. Just wait for the credentials to appear!

**Estimated time remaining: 5-8 minutes**

---

**🎉 Once complete, you'll see:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          Installation Complete! ✓                     ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Then run: `./deploy-qdata.sh`
